                Hi! My name is Gisselle Maxil Leon, I am from Mexico. I like reading ‚Äî whenever I love someone, I want
                to
                read something to them because for me it's relaxing and fun. I love nature ‚Äî the place where I live is
                tropical, so every morning I try to go swim with my mom.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really like technology. One of my brothers is a programmer, and I‚Äôve always wanted to develop those
                skills. I love spending time with my family ‚Äî they are the most important thing for me. They are my gold
                in
                life. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and it makes my life so happy.
